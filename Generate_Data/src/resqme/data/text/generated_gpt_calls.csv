I tried shaking him, nothing... tried yelling in his ear but nothin'. He's just out cold... Oh man, oh man, he's all pale too, he's gone white like-a-sheet. I don't know why he's like this. 

And, and his heart... it's going all weird. Like, it's not regular, you know, it's... it's skippin' or something... beating strange, too fast. I can feel it under my fingers, it's not right. No, it's not right at all! Never felt anything like this...

This is bad, real bad, isn't it? He was fine! He was completely fine just an hour ago, then boom! He passed out, like that! Oh God, I need there to be an ambulance here now. You gotta send help, please, he needs help... please, I don't know what to do..."

And then, before that, she was, uh... like dizzy ya know? Like she couldn't uh...grab onto anything right, kept stumbling around like after too many beers, but she didn't drink, I swear she didn’t.

His heart, man, it's going all weird. Like, it's fluttering or somethin’, not right, not normal, knock knock knocking around in his chest like some mad thing. It's scary. I ain't ever seen nothin' like this before. One minute he's fine, next minute he's down...like, he passed out or somethin’. He ain't waking up, no matter what I do! 

I... I tried to, you know, shake 'im awake, yell at 'im, but it just don’t work. And it's like, he's gone all pale, goddamn ghost-like. Even his lips, man. They ain't got no color no more. What do I do? Help me, man, he's all I got!"

We...we were just, just messing around with something, y'know? Some stupid experiment with a circuit board, and...and something sparked. Oh God, it was like...li-like a mini explosion or something, didn't even see it coming. It...it singed him, y’know, real bad burn on his arm. Skin’s all...uh...it's all messed up, all red...uh...blistery.

Fainting,"Burns, Paleness, Unconsciousness","Oh god, oh god, I...I need help... please, it's really bad. My friend- he...he's... he got hurt real bad. We were working on a... a home project an'-an'-there was a fire - just happened so fast. His hands, his face - all...they're all burnt, badly. Skin's all blistered... and horrible... and just... crimson... Not massive fire, but I...I doused it quickly but...just... I don't know what to do.

His face, his hands, they’re... they're pale...like this ghostly white. He's not...not movin', not responsive. I slapped him round a bit, but he's not...not wakin' up. I feel cold chills just...just lookin' at him...he's just...just unconscious. Just... just lying there...like... this ain't a damn joke. He's not responding to... to anything. No groans, no... no open eyes. I'm... I'm really scared here... my friend...he’s...

He's this big, tough guy, ya know? Always... always so energetic, so unstoppable. And seeing him laying there–so pale, so motionless...burnt and unresponsive... I...I just... I really need something, someone, to come and help. I... don't know what to do... Lord... God...this can't be real... I’m all shaky and... God, please, someone should... should get here quick."
Fainting,"Dizziness, Burns, Arrhythmia","Oh God, please...I need help... an ambulance or something! Oh Lord, I can't think straight. So, I'm here, and... and my husband, he's... he's not alright. He's...uh, freaking me out... Dammit, I can't get my words straight, ah... 

He's... dizzy. Yeah, dizzy like, he can't stand up, and ... he keeps toppling over and stuff. Kind of swaying side to side, like when you're seasick or something ...  He is all ...messed up. And his body, he's... oh God, there's... there's some burns... all over his... his arm, and ...half of his chest. It's so red, and bad, and.. it looks like a really... like a...really bad sunburn or something. But it ain't... ain't no sunburn...

And his heart... Oh God, it's his heart... it's like, it's doing this weird stuff... not like a proper heartbeat, it's not... it's not regular you know, it’s all over the place...jumping, and ...and thumping then going all slow and ... and I can't... I just can't understand it. It’s like that irregular beat... you know... like a bad drum solo or something... And then he's out… like passed out or something... He's not responding!
 
Good Lord, we need help right now, please... this can't happen.. I can't... Can you hear me? He needs...he needs help... I need... I'm scared...Dammit!"
Epilepsy,"Paralysis, Eye Rolling, Burns","Oh God, please. I-I need... I need help. Um... My, my friend... She just, she, oh man, she's not moving. She's like... She's like paralyzed or something. Ain't moving a muscle, I tried shaking her but nothing... God. Nothing at all... She was just fine a minute ago. I mean we... we were just hanging out and then she collapsed, just like that. 

Eyes, her eyes! They...they ain't focusing on anything... They're just rolling back into her head... Like she can't control them. What... what the hell... She doesn't even blink, man. It's it's like she can't see anything... Doesn't respond when I wave my hand.

Oh my God... Wait, wait... God, her wrists... They're... they're red and blistered, like... like she touched something hot, but she didn't, I swear. We weren't near anything hot. Just hurts to look at. Like a cooking burn but, but worse... How did I not see it before? Just developed so fast... Oh God...

Oh God, I need help right now. You’ve gotta send someone fast or I don't...I don't know what'll happen. What's wrong with her? What can I do? I-I don't know anything about this. I'm lost. I need help, please."
Epilepsy,"Arrhythmia, Paralysis, Unconsciousness","Oh God...hello? Oh my lord, help me please, something’s wrong...he's not waking up! He went down like a... like a sack of bricks. One moment he's there, you know, and the next he's on the floor, he ain't... he ain't moving at all! 

Yeah we were having our dinner and I don't know...I don’t goddamn know, he... he was acting all strange. Like he was holding his chest, real tight around his heart...his face all red and sweaty. It was...the beat of his heart I could feel it...it wasn't right, I mean, you know, like somethin' was off. I'm not sure but...it's as if his heart was out of flow...jeez, has it even stopped? Oh God please... 

And... and he's not moving his left side. His left arm's all limp and his left leg too, it's...shit! It's not moving. Like as if...God I don’t know! As if it’s not... not part of him any more. He ain't twitching or nothing, just fucking... laying there all still-like. 

Oh God, I'm scared! Do...do I need to do something? CPR? Oh Jesus I don't remember how...I'm so goddamn useless... we need help like right now! He just went all...what's it called, like blank and then...down he goes. He ain’t woken up since then...I can’t... Oh God he needs help...Now!"

Skips, I guess... God, it feels all wrong. I've never felt a pulse do that before...

Some time ago, I dunno, before... She was just... She wasn't herself... very confused... kept forgetting stuff... asked me the same things over and over... Got so frustrated, slamming things... but she ain't never like that... normally so gentle. Just wasn't like her at all... Then she got dizzy, I guess, just dropped to the floor outta the blue... 

She's still not moving... I can't... can't wake her up, no matter how much I shake her or yell her name... it's like she's just... she ain't here... eyes all wide open, staring but like she's not really seeing anything... and her skin is cold... so Cold...

And there's... stuff, some... some white foamy stuff around his mouth. What the hell is that? He's... he's trying to say something but all that's coming out is... is the foam. It's... it's terrifying, like one of those horror movies but... but it's real, you gotta help!

I'm not sure what to do, I just... I just got home and he's just lying there like this. He was just fine this morning. He was normal, nothing weird about him, and now, he's just... like this...

Before he... before I found him on the floor, he was acting weird, you know... He was all over the place, just wandering around the house like he didn't know where he was or something... He was just aimless... like really confused... or dazed, you know... He'd look at me like... like he didn't recognize me... His speech was all garbled, like he's talking in tongues.
